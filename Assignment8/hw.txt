1. Even if the other teams really had been observing all the bytes going across the network in our lab exercise, the reulting network would still be secure.
This is because we use ssh, which is secure, and therefore the messages we transmit are encrypted.
The other teams would need private keys to be able to see the messages.

    1. Even if the other teams had also tapped our keyboards and obtained our team's keystrokes during later operation, the network would still be secure.
    This is because the other teams will still not have access to our private keys, and they need it to see the messages.
    Seeing the username and password is not enough.

    2. If I am booting off USB and the other teams temporarily had physical control of the USB, the netword would no longer be secure.
    This is because the private keys can be accessed, since they are in the beaglebone and it can be accessed through the USB.

2. The gpg2 --verify command doesn't really verify that you personally created the file, because it verifies if it is generated by a general group, not individual.
--verify cannot pinpoint it to a certain individual, and it can be created by someone that's not you.
I would fix this problem by giving the reciever my public key, so it knows it was created by me.
