1. I used ssh-keygen to generate the ssh key which returned:
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
a9:10:76:0c:8a:0e:61:19:ab:32:79:94:04:98:a5:74 root@beaglebone
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|+B=E.            |
|=*oo o           |
|+.+ o o          |
|+o . o   .       |
|=.. .   S        |
|.o   . .         |

2. I used the following commands to create a user for my partner and provide him access:
sudo useradd -d /home/guest -m chris
sudo passwd chris
cd /home/chris
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown -R chris .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

3. I then use ifconfig to check the IP of my beaglebone: 10.97.85.134
My partner's: 10.97.85.133

4. I used ssh-copy-id -i dhruv@10.97.85.133 to copy the key to server which printed:
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys


5. I used eval $(ssh-agent) and ssh-add to add keys to the server.
It returned:
Agent pid 1835

6. I used ssh -X dhruv@10.97.85.133 to connect to the server, which printed:
Debian GNU/Linux 8

7. I used xeyes and firefox to see if they worked on my partner's beaglebone, and they both worked. Xeyes displayed eyes that followed the cursor and firefox opened a firefox browser.
