1. The patch improved the performance of ls, because by convention, the last option in a command should overrule any other conflicting option, and the patch restored that convention to ls, making it correct.
2. New versions of Coreutils would be based on the bugged version of ls, so the patch might disrupt new versions from correctly updating/adjusting the ls command.
3. The script threw the following error message: IndexError: list index out of range. This is because the script prints a random line from a file, and since /dev/null is empty, there are no lines to print.
4. The script threw the following error message when run using Python 3: SyntaxError: invalid syntax. This is because there is a difference in syntax between Python 2 and Python 3, and since the script is written in Python 2, it cannot be invoked in Python 3.
5. When I run the shuf.py script with Python 2 instead of Python 3, the script still runs correctly, so it seems that Python 3 is still compatible with Python 2.
