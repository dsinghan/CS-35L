1. I got a copy of the Diffutils repository using git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils

2. I got a log of changes to Diffutil's master branchand put it into a log using git log > git-log.txt

3. I generated a list of tags and put it into a file using git tag > git-tags.txt

4. I found the specified commit using emacs git-log.txt C-s "maint: quote" which resulted in 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f
I generated a patch for the commit using git format-patch -1 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f --stdout > quote-patch.txt

5. I checkout version 3.0 of Diffutils from my repository using git checkout v3.0

6. I applied quote-patch.txt using patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt

7. I got an overview of what happened using git status which resulted in
HEAD detached at v3.0

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

8. I studied the emacs functions.

9. I reverted all the changes to files other than .c using C-x v u yes while in the file and I did this to all files.
I undid all the changes to .c files other than character string constants using C-x v = C-c C-a y to all teh c files.

10. I examined src/*.c.rej and copied rejected patches using find . -name "*.c.rej" and then within each file I used C-s ` and replaced it with '

11. I removed all untracked files that were warned about using git clean -f

12. I used git status which returned
HEAD detached at v3.0

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

I stored the patch using git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt

13. I built the resulting modified version of Diffutils using ./bootstrap and patch -p0 <../diffutils-gets.diff and ./configure and make and make check

14. I did a sanity test using diffutils/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch > quote-3.0-test.txt

15. I used diff quote-3.0-test.txt quote-3.0-patch.txt to compare the contents of the files. There are only innoculous differences.
